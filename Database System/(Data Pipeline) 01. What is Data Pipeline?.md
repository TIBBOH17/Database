# Data Pipeline
- A set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.
- Necessary because raw data often must undergo preparations before it can be used.

# Data Pipeline vs. ETL Pipeline
- **Data Pipeline**
    - A broad term encompassing any process that moves data from one source to another.
- **ETL Pipeline**
    - A type of data pipeline that focuses on individual batches of data for a specific purpose.
    - Transformation may or may not be involved in other data pipelines, but it is always present in the ETL process.
