# Data Warehouse
- A central reprository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions.
- Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systemsm, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence.

# Features of Data Warehouse
- **Subject-Oriented**
    - A data warehouse targets on the modeling and analysis of data for decision-makers.
    - A data warehouse typically provides a concise and straightforward view around a particular subject.
- **Integrated**
    - A data warehouse is developed by integrating data from varied sources into a consistent format.
    - The data must be stored in the warehouse in a consistent and universally acceptable manner in terms of naming, format, and coding.
- **Time-Variant**
    - The data stored in a data warehouse is documented with an element of time, either explicitly or implicitly.
    - An example of time variance in a data warehouse is exhibited in the Primary Key, which must have an element of time like the day, week, or month.
- **Non-Volatile**
    - A data once entered into a data warehouse must remain unchanged.
    - All data is read-only and previous data is not erased when current data is entered.

# Concepts of Data Warehouse
- **Operational Source**
    - A data source consists of operational data and external data.
    - Data can come from RDBMS.
- **Load Manager**
    - Performs all operations associated with the extraction of loading data in the data warehouse.
- **Warehouse Manager**
    - The operations performed by the warehouse manager are the analysis, aggregation, backup and collection of data, de-normalization of the data.
- **Query Manager**
    - Performs all the tasks associated with the management of user queries.
    - The complexity of the query manager is determined by the end-user access operations tool and the features provided by the database.
- **Detailed Data**
    - Used to store all the detailed data in the database schema.
    - Loaded into the data warehouse to complement the data collected.
-  **Summarized Data**
    - A part of the data warehouse that stores predefined aggregations.
    - Aggregations are generated by the warehouse manager.
- **Archive and Backup Data**
    - The Detailed and Summarized Data are stored for the purpose of archiving and backup.
    - The data is relocated to storage archives such as magnetic tapes or optical disks.
- **Metadata**
    - Basically, data stored above data.
    - Used for extraction and loading process, warehouse, management process, and query management process.
- **End User Access Tool**
    - consists of analysis, reporting, and mining.
    - By using end-user access tools, users can link with the warehouse.

# Benefits of Data Warehouse
- Informed decision making.
- Consolidated data from many sources.
- Historical data analysis.
- Data quality, consistency, and accuracy.
- Separation of analytics processing from transactional databases, which improves performance of both systems.
