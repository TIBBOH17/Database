# Data Warehouse
- A central reprository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions.
- Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systemsm, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence.

# Features of Data Warehouse
- **Subject-Oriented**
  - A data warehouse targets on the modeling and analysis of data for decision-makers.
  - A data warehouse typically provides a concise and straightforward view around a particular subject.
- **Integrated**
  - A data warehouse is developed by integrating data from varied sources into a consistent format.
  - The data must be stored in the warehouse in a consistent and universally acceptable manner in terms of naming, format, and coding.
- **Non-Volatile**
  - A data once entered into a data warehouse must remain unchanged.
  - All data is read-only and previous data is not erased when current data is entered.
- **Time-Variant**
  - The data stored in a data warehouse is documented with an element of time, either explicitly or implicitly.
  - An example of time variance in a data warehouse is exhibited in the Primary Key, which must have an element of time like the day, week, or month.

# Benefits of Data Warehouse
- Informed decision making.
- Consolidated data from many sources.
- Historical data analysis.
- Data quality, consistency, and accuracy.
- Separation of analytics processing from transactional databases, which improves performance of both systems.
