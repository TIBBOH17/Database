# Data Pipeline
- A set of tools and processes used to automate the movement and transformation of data between a source system and a target repository.
- Necessary because raw data often must undergo preparations before it can be used.

# Types of Pipeline
- **Batch Processing**
    - Data is collected and processed in discrete chunks or batches at scheduled intervals.
    - Well-suited for scenarios where real-time processing is not required, such as generating daily reports or running analytics on historical data.
- **Real-time Processing**
    - Processes data as soon as it becomes available, allowing for immediate analysis and action.
    - Essential for applications like fraud detection, monitoring, and personalized recommendations where timely insights are crucial.
- **Hybrid Approaches**
    - Some pipelines combine both batch and real-time processing to leverage the benefits of each approach.
    - For example, batch processing can be used for historical analysis, while real-time processing handles incoming data streams for immediate decision-making.
 
# Concepts of Data Pipeline
- **Data Source**
    - The origin point of the data within the pipeline.
    - Each data source may have its own format, structure, and access method.
- **Data Processing**
    - Involves transforming and cleaning the raw data to make it suitable for analysis.
    - Commonly includes tasks such as data validation, deduplication, normalization, enrichment, aggregation, filtering, or joining multiple datasets.
- **Destination**
    - Where the data arrives at the end of its processing.
    - Typically a data lake or data warehouse for analysis.

# Advantages of Data Pipeline
- **Efficiency**
    - Data pipeline automates the flow of data, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risk of errors.
- **Real-time Insights**
    - With the ability to process data in real-time, data pipeline empowers organizations to derive insights quickly and makes informed decisions on the fly.
- **Scalability**
    - Scalable architectures in data pipeline allow organizations to handle growing volumes of data without compromising performance, ensuring adaptability to changing business needs.
- **Data Quality**
    - By incorporating data cleansing and transformation steps, data pipeline contributes to maintaining high data quality standards, ensuring that the information being processed is accurate and reliable.
- **Cost-Effective**
    - Automation and optimization of data processing workflows result in cost savings by reducing manual labor, minimizing errors, and optimizing resource utilization.
