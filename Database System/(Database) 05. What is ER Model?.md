    - Contains entities with attributes that share similar values.
- **Strong Entity**
    - An entity type that has a key attribute.
    - Doesn't depend on other entities in the schema.
    - Represented by a single rectangle in ER diagram.
- **Weak Entity**
    - An entity type that doesnâ€™t have a key attribute.
    - Cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone.
    - Represented by a double-outlined rectangle in ER diagrams.
 
# Concepts of Attribute
- **Simple Attribute**
    - Key attribute.
    - An attribute that cannot be further decomposed into sub-attributes.
    - Represented by an oval with a underlying line in ER diagram.
- **Composit Attribute**
    - An attribute that is composed of many other attributes and can be decomposed into simple attributes.
    - Represented by an oval comprising of ovals in ER diagram.
- **Multivalued Attribute**
    - An attribute that can have more that ont value.
    - Represented by a double oval in ER diagram.
