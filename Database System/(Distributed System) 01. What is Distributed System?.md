# Distributed System
- A collection of computer programs that utilize computational resources across multiple, separate computation nodes to achieve a common, shared goal.
- Aims to remove bottlenecks or central points of failure from a system.

# Features of Distributed System
- **Resource Sharing**
    - The ability to use any hardware, software, or data anywhere in the system.
- **Openness**
    - Concerned with extensions and improvements in the system.
    - How openly the software is developed and shared with others.
- **Scalability**
    - The ability to grow as the size of the workload increases accomplished by adding additional processing units or nodes to the network as needed.
- **Concurrency**
    - Components run simultaneously.
    - Also characterized by the lack of a global clock, when tasks occur out of sequence and at different rates.
- **Fault Tolerance**
    - If one node fails, the remaining nodes can continue to operate without disrupting the overall computation.
- **Heterogeneity**
    - The components of distributed systems may differ and vary in operating systems, networks, programming languages, computer hardware, and implementations by different developers.
    - This allows the distributed systems to be extended with the addition of new components.
- **Replication**
    - Enables shared information and messaging, ensuring consistency between redundant resources, such as software or hardware components, improving fault tolerance, reliability and accessibility.
- **Transparency**
    - The end user sees a distributed system as a single computational unit rather than as its underlying parts, allowing users to interact with a single logical device rather than being concerned with the systemâ€™s architecture.
    - Hides the complexity of the distributed systems to the users and application programs as there should be privacy in every system.
