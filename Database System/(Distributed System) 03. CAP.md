# CAP
- A theorem states that a distributed system can deliver only two of three desired characteristics.

# Concepts of CAP
- **Consistency**
    - All the replicas that have a particular record must return the exact same value.
- **Availability**
    - All the active nodes at any moment must be able to respond to different operations.
- **Partition Tolerance**
    - The system must be able to tolerate network partition among its participant nodes.
