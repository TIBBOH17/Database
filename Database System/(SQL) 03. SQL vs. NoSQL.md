# Main differences between SQL and NoSQL
- **Structure**
    - **SQL** databases are table based.
    - **NoSQL** databases can be document-oriented, key-value pairs, or graph structures.
- **Scalability**
    - **SQL** databases scale vertically, usually on a single server, and require users to increase physical hardware to increase their storage capacities.
    - **NoSQL** databases offer horizontal scalability, meaning that more servers simply need to be added to increase their data load.
- **Language**
    - SQL databases use SQL.
    - NoSQL databases use JSON, XML, YAML, or binary schema, facilitating unstructured data.
- **Support**
    - **SQL** is a popular standard language that is well supported by many different database systems.
    - **NoSQL** has varying levels of support in various database systems.
 
# Pros and cons of SQL
- **Pros of SQL**
    - **SQL** is widely understood and supported.
    - **SQL** is extremely useful for simple aggregations over large datasets.
    - **SQL** is extremely useful for setting up simple ETL jobs.
    - **SQL** is well-documented and easy to learn.
- **Cons of SQL**
    - The performance of SQL can be poor on substantial data sets because it requires multiple passes over the data to complete many operations.
    - Debugging SQL can be complicated because it doesn't provide informative error messages.
    - The syntax of SQL tends to be verbose compared with programming languages.
 
# Pros and cons of NoSQL
- **Pros of NoSQL**
    - Flexible schema.
    - Usable on distributed infrastructure platforms.
    - Low-cost infrastructure.
    - High availability and throughput.
- **Cons of NoSQL**
    - Less mature technology and difficult to manage.
    - Limited query capabilities.
    - Data inconsistency and poor performance in some complex scenarios.
