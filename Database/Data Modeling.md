# Data Modeling
- The process of transferring datas existing in the real world to the database in the computer.
- The process of creating a visual representation or a blueprint that defines the information collection and management systems of any organization.

# Concepts of Data Modeling
- **Conceptual data modeling**
  - The typical starting point for data modeling, identifying the various data sets and data flow through the organization.
  - Represents the overall structure and content but not the detail of the data plan.

- **Logical data modeling**
  - The general definition of “data model” in that it describes the data flow and database content.
  - Adds detail to the overall structure in the conceptual model but does not include specifications for the database itself.

- **Physical data modeling**
  - Describes the specifics of how the logical model will be realized.
  - Maps the logical data model to a specific DBMS technology and use the software’s terminology.
